    Sample :T: times from two survival populations with 
    initial sizes :N1: and :N2:
    In each time t and group j, the reduction `Oj`
    is a Possion RV. Usually, the Poisson rates
    are identical. Although in :eps: fraction the times the 
    Poisson rate of O2 are elevated by :mu:

    :T:    number of events

    :eps:  fraction of non-null events

    Note that since we sample from two Poisson distributions 
    in each 'event', there is some possibility that we draw (O1,O2) = (0,0),
    hence there is no change in that event. This situation is different 
    than standard notation.
